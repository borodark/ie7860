## Resource Management Domain
The resource management is ".. the efficient and effective development of an organization's resources when they are needed. Such resources may include the financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or information technology (IT) and natural resources." acording to Wikipedia. I was always interested in the general theory of resource management, especially in the realm of computer sciense, where there is no such thing as unlimited storage or bandwidth.
